# About


The ecosystem represents a wholistic commitment to the user and to securing our digital futures. Each proposed solution is a highly optimized, well researched implementation 
of cutting-edge technologies. We hope to provide the foundation for a truly free digital future where users are simply limited by their creativity and finally fulfilling 
the promise of blockchain technology, with a robust financial system designed for everyday use. With our platform, we hope to inspire a generation of doers, building their 
digital environments to work for them rather than on them. As technologies reach expands exponentially by the day, it is more important than ever to consider the way your 
information is being processed. Global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia v. Ukraine conflict have only accelerated the rise of technology pushing developers into 
the spotlight while ensuring the rise of cloud platforms. Each of these come on the tail-end of the initial rollout of 5G technologies, providing service providers with ample 
opportunity to build, test, and optimize their cloud platforms further ensnaring the public within their grasp. Throughout the course of time, the old mom n’ pop shops have 
been pushed to the wayside. Service providers have seemingly forgotten about small businesses, charging obscene fees for their products. Worse of all, the government has failed 
to reign in tech behemoths enabling them to continue with their malicious practices regarding their usage of personal information. Blockchain and decentralized technologies 
have provided a solution for many of the issues common to traditional providers yet have continuously failed to uphold the true promise of the idea. Furthermore, recent defi 
catastrophes, such as Terra, have further polluted the public’s viewpoint. Sadly however, it seems that centralized service providers have strategically downplayed the significance 
of blockchain and decentralization while repeatedly copying its principals. One of the most recent examples happens to be in authentication with the advent of the FIDO Alliance 
PassKey which simply enables applications to access a single credential stored on a specific host. The FIDO Alliance is a group of mega-corporations such as Apple, Google, and 
Facebook all of which are companies currently pursuing at least one of their own variants to some blockchain technology. Rather than questioning the technology, question the 
source to discover where the digital landscape is truly heading, and I am certain you will find little comfort in the ethics and practices common in traditional institutions. 
Blockchain was initially developed with the intention of distributing the very computer or command line the creator was operating at the time enabling for a host of novel transactions 
to occur and introduced the first tangible of digital currency. Removing all the hardware from a computer while enabling it to retain the fundamental differences that ensure each 
experience is outfitted to the users’ specifications, such as with an operating system, is a daunting task yet one being actively explored. Deta Space and WASMCloud are some examples 
of more traditional mindsets being applied to this concept. While these projects may offer a few of the capabilities of our platform, none can compare with the security and usability 
envisioned for the ecosystem. Our reliance on quantum resilient cryptographic protocols ensures the fidelity of each interaction facilitated by our systems. Additionally, the 
underlying architecture empowers users immerse themselves in highly customized digital environments which they can use to benefit them in any number of ways. Our primary focus is on 
enabling educational and professional development, a concept best shown with the introduction of stacked-guidelines, professional pipelines, and the enterprise grade creative studio. 
Lastly, all users will be fully equipped with each of the tools required to regain and retain control over their digital entities. Users will be encouraged to register compatible 
devices to best suite their day to day needs or to enable them to monetize their excess resources, participating in either computational or data-oriented workloads prescribed by 
the injected device analyzer.
